simpleOWLAPI is a light-weight wrapper for the [OWLAPI](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi) that enables faster development of [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) ontologies with more concise code using the power of the [Manchester OWL Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/) and related parsers. The wrapper does not make use of all the features of the more powerful OWLAPI. Rather, it is designed specifically for rapid and concise ontology construction in workflows involving semantic data engineering. It can also be used in contexts such as educational and demonstration settings in courses, workshops and tutorials. In particular, the library can also be used in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) using a Java kernel such as the [IJava kernel](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava).

### Usage in Jupyter notebooks

##### Requirements

1. [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
2. [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) Jupyter kernel
3. [Java JDK 1.9+](https://jdk.java.net/) linked to your IJava kernel

##### Importing

When using simpleOWLAPI with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) using the [IJava kernel](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava), importing the library using ``%maven`` and ``%%loadFromPOM`` [magics](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava/blob/master/docs/magics.md) is known to cause problems due to [.ivy2](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.5.0/settings/caches.html) caching conflicts. The solution is to download the .jar file of simpleOWLAPI **with packaged dependencies** from the [releases](https://github.com/kodymoodley/simpleowlapi/releases/) section and import this file manually into your IJava notebook by running the ``%jars path/to/jar/file/simpleowlapi-lib-${version}.jar`` command from a single dedicated cell in the notebook.

##### Dependencies

The simpleOWLAPI release for Jupyter notebooks is bundled into one .jar file for convenience. This file includes the following dependencies (see [pom.xml](https://github.com/kodymoodley/simpleowlapi/blob/master/pom.xml) for specific versions):

...

// Switch or set OWL reasoner 
s.setOWLReasoner(SelectedReasoner.HERMIT); 

// prints to console Yes if currently selected ontology is consistent, No otherwise
s.owlReasoner.isConsistent(); 
// computes and prints to console all explanations for the inconsistency of the selected ontology (provided it is inconsistent)
s.owlReasoner.explainInconsistency(); 

// prints to console Yes if the given class expression is satisfiable, No otherwiseNo otherwise
s.owlReasoner.isSatisfiable("Penguin");
// computes and prints to console all explanations for the unsatisfiability of the given class expression w.r.t. the active ontology (provided it is indeed unsatisfiable)
s.owlReasoner.explainUnsatisfiability("Penguin"); 

// prints to console Yes if the given axiom is entailed by the currently selected ontology, No otherwise
s.owlReasoner.isEntailed("Robin subClassOf FlyingOrganism"); 
// computes and prints to console all explanations for the entailment of the given axiom w.r.t. the selected ontology (provided it is indeed entailed)
s.owlReasoner.explainEntailment("Robin subClassOf FlyingOrganism"); 

// computes and prints to console all super classes (indirect) for the given class expression

// computes and prints to console all class names for which the given individual is an instance
s.owlReasoner.getTypes("tweety"); 
// for each individual name in the selected ontology, computes and prints to console all class names such that this individual is an instance of the class name
s.owlReasoner.getAllTypes(); 
// computes and prints to console all instances of the given class expression
s.owlReasoner.getInstances("Robin and not FlyingOrganism); 

// given an object property name R, prints to console all individual name pairs (a,b) such that R(a, b) is an object property assertion entailed by the selected ontology
s.owlReasoner.getObjectPropertyAssertions("knows"); 
// for each object property R in the ontology, prints to console all individual name pairs (a,b) such that R(a, b) is an object property assertion entailed by the active ontology
s.owlReasoner.getAllObjectPropertyAssertions(); 

// prints to console the name of the OWL reasoner which is currently being used by the simpleOWLAPIFactory instance

### For Developers: Building the library from source

##### Requirements:

+ Apache's [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/index.html).
+ A tool for checking out a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository.

##### Steps:

1. Get a copy of the code:

        git clone https://github.com/kodymoodley/simpleowlapi.git
    
2. Change into the `simpleowlapi/` directory.

3. Type `mvn clean package`.  On build completion, the `target/` directory will contain two versions of the library: `simpleowlapi-lib-${version}.jar` and `simpleowlapi-lib-${version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
